		  <h1 id="1">Best free website builder 2020</h1>
<p>.</p>
<p>Building a website used to be the domain (geddit?) of professional designers and programmers, but thanks to free website builder apps, anyone can do it these days. The problem is that there are so many website-building apps and services competing for attention that it can be hard to know which one to choose - here's where we can help.</p>
<p>As a Linux-compatible web editor, Bluefish was always a good editor thanks to the many features it offered users. But after the new version of the program - 2. 0 - it really became one of the best among other free website builders, thanks to the addition of several new features. In addition to the native Mac and Windows programs, there is a code-dependent spell checker, autosave, snippets, project management and autocomplete in different languages like php, html, css, etc. Although Bluefish is more of a code editor than a web editor, it still offers a lot of flexibility to developers who want to explore options other than html.</p>
<p>Godaddy is the only site builder based entirely on the adi - artificial design intelligence approach. You tell the site builder what business you represent, what you want from a website, what personal features and information you have, and let it create everything for you on the fly. It may take you a little while to answer all these questions at first, but then you get a finished product that works like magic. Of course, you can manually tweak some pages afterwards. This website builder is used by around 18 million websites and offers the longest free trial period of all website builders: 1 month.</p>
<p>The website builder offered by Constant Contact is 100% available with their free plan, making it a fantastic option if you don't want to spend money. Constant Contact will even provide you with a free domain name for a year. The builder itself is easy to use and simple. Everything is intuitive and they haven't tried to reinvent the wheel. They have included good templates that can be easily adapted depending on what you need. There's even a tool from a. I. Powered that can steal everything from your Facebook page and build your page with the content you've pulled.</p>
